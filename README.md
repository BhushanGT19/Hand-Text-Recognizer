For this project i am using python 3.6 on anaconda. More importantly i am running it on Jupyter Notebook sometimes but Google Colab is what is used most. For model train/test, Colab is used. For real world image recogniton, i used my Intel I5 with 8gb RAM. The dependencies and libraries i used are:
Python 3.6
Numpy
Matplotlib
OpenCv
Keras
